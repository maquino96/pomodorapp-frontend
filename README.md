# PomodorApp-frontend #

___For my latest work, please visit my [personal website](https://www.mattaquino.dev/)___

PomodorApp was built with VanillaJS and a Ruby on Rails backend, along with styling using the Bulma CSS Framework.

The app is a work and break timer based off the pomodoro method.

Notable features:
* Includes a custom built timer made using built-in JavaScript functions.
* A spotify widget to stream playlists.
* A snippet of advice is pulled from an API and displayed underneath the timer. 
* A user can create tasks and complete tasks during a study session.
* Once study sessions are completed (timer stopped) all tasks completed during that session will be saved and stored in the user's repository of previous study sessions. 

<!-- This was the first app created with JavaScript getting a good handle on event listeners and event propgation, the core tenets of DOM Manipulation. I dove really deep into event propagation and wrote a [blog post](https://matthewaquino.medium.com/event-delegation-in-javascript-677443938ce2) about it. Very much enjoyed learning about this form of web development but could see many of it's shortcomings, queue React. Some of the challenges faced during this experience was dealing with Date objects and Time in JS. Converting between Ruby time standards and JS time standards was a headache. Having more experience now I understand the value of Unix time and use it for this exact purpose of switching between 2 languages / standards. Another challenge was that developing this way is considered imperative coding, the index.js file  was 500+ lines by itself, there was a lot of scrolling up and down as well as cmd + f searching, having to tell the computer what to do for each step is a good learning experience the first few times but not a great developer experience, again queue React. Design wise I'm a little unnerved by the lack of symmetry but I did learn some neat css tricks and not bad considering this was my first JS app.  -->
